== Dart

* https://github.com/dart-lang/samples/blob/b8bac3a6c45c5b330dc5be70ed86df2dfd94b1b1/ffi/structs/structs.dart#L74[caller] - Dart
* https://github.com/dart-lang/samples/blob/b8bac3a6c4/ffi/structs/structs_library/structs.c#L22[callee] - C

calee が `malloc` で領域確保し関数戻り値でポインタを返している。
サンプルコードだからか、領域を開放する実装は無い(ためこのままだとメモリリークする)。

== Go

Memory allocations made by C code are not known to Go's memory manager. When you create a C string with C.CString (or any C memory allocation) you must remember to free the memory when you're done with it by calling C.free.

The call to C.CString returns a pointer to the start of the char array, so before the function exits we convert it to an unsafe.Pointer and release the memory allocation with C.free. A common idiom in cgo programs is to defer the free immediately after allocating (especially when the code that follows is more complex than a single function call), as in this rewrite of Print:

func main() {
	cs := C.CString("Hello from stdio")
	C.myprint(cs)
	C.free(unsafe.Pointer(cs))
}

Of course, you aren't required to use defer to call C.free(). You can free the C string whenever you like, but it is your responsibility to make sure it happens.
